# Password Generator

This was a very frustrating and difficult challenge for me.  I learned a lot in working on it and in particular in spending a full tutoring session on it.  Much of the random/math/var code was done during that session and I'm at about 50% of understanding it.  

I was able to get the prompts loaded and I have some of the generator itself but i'm not understanding the connections of the functions and variables and math to get it to actually run.
